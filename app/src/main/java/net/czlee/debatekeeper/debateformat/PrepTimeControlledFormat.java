/**
 * PrepTimeControlledFormat is a passive data class that holds information about a prep
 * time format which is controlled by the chair.  This is in contrast to
 * {@link PrepTimeSimpleFormat} which is not controlled by the chair and applies
 * to the majority of debate formats.  In a controlled prep time, bells are rung
 * by the chair to indicate certain events, and all teams are in the room for all
 * preparation.
 *
 * Its functionality is mostly derived from {@link ControlledDebatePhaseFormat}.
