        \n• Debate style formats are now available for download, with only four included in the app.
            You may need to download the formats you were previously using to continue.
        \n• Added support for multilingual debate formats, with thanks to Frank Richter. (BP is in
            English and Spanish; OPD is in German and English.)
        \n• All formats are now stored in an app-specific Android location. If you have custom
            formats, you\'ll be prompted to copy them over. Note: If you uninstall Debatekeeper,
            custom formats will be deleted, so be sure to have a backup somewhere else.
        \n• French, German and Spanish interface for devices in those languages
        \n• New icon, thanks to Alberto Martínez
        \n• Timer text size now auto-adjusts in Android 8.0 and higher
        \n• Removed leading zero from minutes
        \n• Made double and triple bells more evenly timed
        \n• Added a way to initiate file imports from inside the app
        \n• Simplified handling of malformed debate style files
        \n• Fixed notification and service handling
        \n• Other general updates to bring up to date with Android 10
